This repository implements a complete, end‑to‑end workflow for producing more reliable extreme‐precipitation forecasts by blending bias‑corrected climate‐model outputs with a suite of statistical, machine‑learning, and deep‑learning regressors. At its core lies a novel Quantile‑Wise Multi‑Model Ensemble (QMME) approach: after correcting each GCM’s daily precipitation using Empirical Quantile Mapping, the data are split into five 20 percent quantiles per station. For each quantile, models are evaluated both on historical performance metrics (EVS, JSD, KGE, MAE, PBIAS) and on future uncertainty (standard deviation). These diagnostics yield quantile‑specific weights that first drive a weighted summation of the 14 CMIP6 projections, and then feed into an XGBoost residual model that captures non‑linear interactions and preserves the tails of the distribution.

Complementing QMME’s ensemble core, the repository provides implementations of several regressors for station‑mean precipitation: classical methods (Multiple Linear Regression, K‑Nearest Neighbors, Inverse Distance Weighting), machine‑learning models (Random Forest and hyperparameter‑tuned XGBoost), and a deep‑learning LSTM implemented in PyTorch. Example notebooks guide users through each step—bias correction, weight calculation, model training, and evaluation—while standalone scripts automate batch processing over multiple socio‑economic pathways (SSP245, SSP126, SSP370, SSP585).

Data and code are organized into clear folders: raw bias‑corrected GCM CSVs and weight tables live under data/, Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis and visualization sit in notebooks/, and production scripts for QMME assembly and regressor training reside in scripts/. Upon running these scripts, users will find quantile‑wise ensemble outputs (QMME_Q1.csv…QMME_Q5.csv), model forecasts (RF_predictions.csv, XGB_predictions.csv, LSTM_predictions.csv), and a consolidated performance summary (RMSE_summary.csv) under results/.

Getting started is straightforward: clone the repo, install dependencies, drop your EQM‑corrected CSVs and weight file into data/, and execute the build and training scripts as documented. Visualization notebooks make it easy to compare how each method reproduces both central tendencies and extreme events.
